Version 2.6.2 - 11/01/2018

- Project published on GitHub.



Version 2.6.1 - 28/01/2016

- FIX: The control could crash during OLE drag'n'drop.
- FIX: The control could crash the other process during OLE drag'n'drop, especially when IOLEDataObject::SetDropDescription() had been called.



Version 2.6.0 - 20/01/2016

- Added the IProgressBar::FinishOLEDragDrop method. It should not be used if not really needed. It can be used to hide the drag image if execution of the OLEDragDrop event takes a long time or if a message is displayed from within this event.
- Initial support for Windows 10.



Version 2.5.0 - 10/07/2014

- Added the XClick, and XDblClick events for support of the extended mouse buttons.
- Extended the Mouse* events to support the extended mouse buttons.
- FIX: The Font and MouseIcon properties could leak GDI resources.
- Reactivated data-binding capabilities. When the library is registered, it will call regtlib.exe msdatsrc.tlb before registering itself. This seems to fix the mess caused by the broken Windows Update from the beginning of 2013.
- Initial support for Windows 8.1.



Version 2.4.2 - 27/03/2013

- FIX: The ResizedControlWindow event was not fired when it should have been fired.
- Disabled data-binding capabilities as they cause "Object library not registered" errors when adding the control library to the project. This problem might be related to a recent Windows Update.
- Initial support for Windows 8.



Version 2.4.1 - 29/05/2012

- FIX: Clicking the control no longer raises the Validate event of the currently focused control.



Version 2.4.0 - 16/03/2012

- Added the IProgressBar::DisplayProgressInTaskBar property.
- Added the IProgressBar::hApplicationWindow property.



Version 2.3.0 - 13/11/2011

- Added the IProgressBar::DetectDoubleClicks property to completely deactivate double clicks and handle them as two single clicks instead.
- Added the IProgressBar::DisplayText property.
- Added the IProgressBar::Font property.
- Added the IProgressBar::ForeColor property.
- Added the IProgressBar::HAlignment property.
- Added the IProgressBar::RightToLeft property and declared the IProgressBar::RightToLeftLayout property deprecated.
- Added the IProgressBar::Text property.
- Added the IProgressBar::TextShadowColor property.
- Added the IProgressBar::TextShadowOffsetX property.
- Added the IProgressBar::TextShadowOffsetY property.
- Added the IProgressBar::UseSystemFont property.



Version 2.2.1 - 21/05/2011

- Fixed a bug that could make other, invisible windows visible again under rather complex circumstances. I'm not sure this could happen practically, but in theory it could happen and practically it did happen for the Frame control which had the same bug.
- FIX: The ResizedControlWindow event was fired when actually nothing had changed.



Version 2.2.0 - 08/01/2011

- Switched to Visual C++ 2010 and dropped support for Windows 2000.



Version 2.1.4 - 07/11/2010

Version 2.1.3 - 02/01/2010

- Fixed a potential problem with persistance.
- Improved support for Aero drag images.
- Improved performance.
- FIX: The 'shift' parameter that many events have, often missed the ALT key.
- Deploy (stripped) symbols with the binaries to make debugging easier. This are the pdb files in case you wonder.



Version 2.1.2 - 11/07/2009

- Initial support for Windows 7.
- Extended the AppearanceConstants enumeration by 'aDefault'.
- Extended the DropDescriptionIconConstants enumeration by 'ddiUseDefault'.
- FIX: Drop descriptions didn't work as expected if the drag source was a 64 bit app.
- Massively reduced the usage of GDI handles.
- Made some internal changes that will make it easier for me to keep binary compatibility in future.



Version 2.1.1 - 30/10/2008

- FIX: Ignore calls to IOLEDataObject::SetDropDescription() if the drag image is in classic style.
- Fixed some GDI handle leaks.
- Fixed some drawing glitches.
- Slightly changed handling of the situation where the user presses a mouse button, drags the mouse out of the control's client area and releases the button.
- Removed the data-binding stuff (it was probably broken anyway).
- Switched to Visual C++ 2008 and dropped support for Windows 9x, Me and NT 4.0.
- Improved the documentation.



Version 2.1.0 - 04/12/2007

- Added the IOLEDataObject::GetDropDescription() method.
- Added the IOLEDataObject::SetDropDescription() method.
- FIX: Changes were not applied implicitly when jumping between multiple instances of the control with the property pages opened.
